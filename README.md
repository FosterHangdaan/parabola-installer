# Overview
[Parabola](www.parabola.nu) is an Arch based GNU/Linux distribution built for everyday use while retaining Arch's power-user charm. Parabola adheres to the [GNU Free System Distribution Guidelines (FSDG)](www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html) and is one of the few distributions endorsed by the Free Software Foundation.

The purpose of this project is to automate the procedures in the [Parabola installation guide](wiki.parabola.nu/Installation_Guide) using shell scripts. This allows users to build a minimal Parabola system quickly and easily.

# Requirements
- Basic proficiency with GNU/Linux and it's command line interface.
- UEFI compatible computer (The vast majority of modern motherboards support this)
- Parabola CLI/Desktop ISO (SystemD variant)
- Only wired networking is supported. If wireless networking is desired, a manual setup is required.
- A copy of this repository on a USB (optional)

# Instructions
The installation disk must be partitioned and an internet connection established before running the script. Refer to INSTRUCTIONS.md for installation procedures.

# Troubleshooting
The primary resource for troubleshooting should be either the [Parabola Wiki](https://wiki.parabola.nu/Main_Page) or [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/).
